# Pipeline Decisions Log

ADR-lite. One entry per non-obvious choice, so we know *why* later.

## D-001 · 2026-05-25 · Five agents, not six

**Decision:** Merge the original C-SPOTTER (social presence) and C-Prospect (financial info) into a single C-SPOTTER that does both in one enrichment pass.

**Context:** Original plan had A3 walking the NAICS-matched business list to capture social handles, then A4 walking the same list again for financial signals.

**Why:**
- Two passes over the same target set = two Notion syncs, two error surfaces, two chances for the lists to drift apart.
- The enrichment is naturally one record per business; splitting it across agents is an org chart, not a data model.

**Trade-off accepted:** C-SPOTTER's job is now bigger. If it grows again (adding e.g. principal-contact lookup, news-mention scraping), revisit splitting along *enrichment-type* lines, not original SPOTTER/Prospect lines.

## D-002 · 2026-05-25 · Templating lives with C-Phile, not C-Transit

**Decision:** C-Transit does intake only. C-Phile owns both synthesis and templating.

**Context:** Original plan had A2 (Transit) both fetching articles AND placing text into per-channel templates.

**Why:**
- Voice and structure must stay coupled. Templating beside synthesis means one agent owns "how a post sounds" end-to-end.
- Templating beside scraping invites drift — Transit would start making editorial decisions ("this article needs the long template") that belong to the voice owner.

**Trade-off accepted:** C-Phile carries more responsibility. If voice quality stays high but throughput dips, consider splitting *Phile-synthesize* from *Phile-render* as sub-stages of the same agent, not as separate agents.

## D-003 · 2026-05-25 · Itch.io belongs to LOFI, not HZ

**Decision:** Drop Itch.io from the HZ outreach platform set. Keep it as a LOFI_SANCTUARY channel only.

**Context:** Original post-its listed Itch.io alongside Twitter/FB/Reddit/Tumblr as part of the HZ content pipeline.

**Why:**
- Itch.io is a creator-community platform. The HZ audience (small businesses under specific NAICS codes) is not on Itch.
- LOFI's audience (cozy-game devs, music-for-games crowd) is exactly who's on Itch. The fit is real there.

**Trade-off accepted:** None — this is a scope correction.

## D-004 · 2026-05-25 · No autonomous posting in v1; scripts over MCPs

**Decision:** Every published artifact is manually posted by JR after approving a C-Comms review packet. Per-platform integration is a Python script in `scripts/`, not an MCP server.

**Context:** Decision could have gone the other way — wire up community MCPs for Twitter/Reddit/Tumblr/FB and let agents post directly.

**Why:**
- Platform-ban risk on autonomous posting is real and asymmetric (a single bad post can cost an account permanently).
- No Anthropic-blessed MCP exists for any of these platforms; community MCPs are maintenance debt.
- Scripts give finer control over rate limits and request shapes than a wrapping MCP would.
- Matches the canonical "Notion via scripts" pattern already used by HZ and LOFI.

**Trade-off accepted:** JR is the throughput bottleneck. Acceptable in v1 because the bottleneck is also the quality gate. Revisit only after two clean cycles ship without packet rework (see PLATFORMS.md "What unlocks an upgrade past v1").
